.Dt WATCHTAB 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm watchtab
.Nd tables for driving filewatcherd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A
.Nm
file contains instructions to the
.Xr filewatcherd 8
daemon of the general form: ``run this command when these events happen
to the file at this path''.
.Pp
Blank lines and leading spaces and tabs are ignored.
Lines whose first non-space character is a pound-sign (#) are comments,
and are ignored. Note that comments are not allowed on the same line as
.Nm
commands, since they will be taken to be part of the command.
Similarly, comments are not allowed on the same line as
environment variable settings.
.Pp
An active line of a
.Nm
will be either an environment setting or a command.
An environment setting is of the form
.Bd -literal
    name = value
.Ed
.Pp
where the spaces around the equal-sign (=) are optional, and any subsequent
non-leading spaces in
.Em value
will be part of the value assigned to
.Em name .
Note that
.Em name
cannot contain any blackslash or tabulation.
.Pp
Several environment variables are set up automatically by the
.Xr filewatcherd 8
daemon.
.Ev LOGNAME
and
.Ev USER
are set to the command user,
.Ev HOME
is set to the home directory of the command user, unless explicitly overriden.
.Ev TRIGGER
is set to the path that has triggered the command execution.
.Pp
The format of a
.Nm
command is a tabulation-separated sequence of fields, interpreted as follow:
.Bl -tag -width command
.It path
Path of the file to watch.
.It events
Set of events which trigger the command. It can either be a single
star-sign (*), or a punctuation-separated list of names among:
DELETE, WRITE, EXTEND, ATTRIB, LINK, RENAME and REVOKE. Their meaning is
defined in
.Xr kqueue 2
for
.Va fflags
for EVFILT_VNODE.
.It delay
Number of seconds, allowing a decimal point, between the trigger and when
the command is actually run.
.It user
User, and optionally group preceded by a colon sign (:), to change to
before running the command.
.It chroot
Path of a directory in which to chroot before running the command.
.It command
The command to run.
.El
.Pp
When less than 6 fields are given in a command line, the
.Va chroot
value is considered omitted, and chroot will be performed.
When less than 5 fields are given, the
.Va user
value is considered omitted, and no setuid or setgid will be performed.
When less than 4 fields are given, the
.Va delay
value is considered as zero.
It is an error to provide less than 3 fields.
